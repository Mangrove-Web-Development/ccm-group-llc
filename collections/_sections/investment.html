      <p>Real estate investing is competitive. There are many small firms that
      rely on friends and family investors to execute transactions, and they are
      usually limited in the size and number of deals that they can do. On the
      other side of the spectrum are larger, institutional investors whose
      minimum deal-size requirements keep them out of many markets.</p>

      <p>CCM focuses on the underserved segment in between these markets. We
      have the experience and knowledge base to rival institutional investors
      with a faster decision-making process and complete discretion regarding
      our investments.</p><p>Being privately funded without the pressure of
      outside investors, CCM offers unique flexibility in both deal structure
      and hold period. Consequently, we make value creation paramount and adapt
      to macroeconomic and microeconomic market conditions. Real estate is
      cyclical, and we are in it for the long run.</p><h2>Mutual respect and
      aligned incentives</h2><p>We know the value of a good operating partner
      and recognize that the best operators have many equity sources. We pride
      ourselves on being a preferred equity source for high-quality operators
      who put a premium on fairness, reliability and quick
      decision-making.</p><p>Based on a model of mutual respect and aligned
      incentives, we have built solid and lasting relationships with <a
      href="/investment/partners">our operating partners</a>. Investing
      alongside these operators allows us to leverage our experience and
      knowledge with theirs to diversify our portfolio by geography, product
      type, risk level, and timing.</p><p>Real estate is local, and the same is
      true of our operating partners. Their geographic focus is where they grew
      up, went to school, and built businesses, resulting in exceptional network
      advantages.</p><p>As a preferred equity source, operators work alongside
      CCM as they source opportunities, allowing us to tailor our investment
      strategy to the specific needs of each deal that meets our risk-and-return
      threshold in a given market.</p>
