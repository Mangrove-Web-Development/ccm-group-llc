  Our investment strategy involves deals sized above what most individual
  investors can afford and below what most institutions are willing to fund,
  allowing us to capitalize on this market inefficiency. We seek true
  partnerships that leverage the knowledge and expertise of the parties
  involved.

      <h2>Tactical investments with minimal risk</h2><p>Generally, larger
      investment transactions require more effort to pursue and are
      significantly more competitive, driving down returns. We seek aggregation
      plays, where we gain efficiency by acquiring multiple deals of a similar
      type.</p><p>As the majority investor, CCM often provides up to 90 percent
      of the equity required in its transactions, using joint ventures with
      flexible return structures. We do not assume additional exposure, such as
      completion or loan guarantees. Ultimately, the goals of our investments
      are strong cash flow and solid returns, with reasonable risk. Patient in
      our deal flow and investment horizon, we typically hold each asset for an
      extended period.</p>
