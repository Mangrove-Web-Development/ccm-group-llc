      <h2>CASTO Southeast</h2><p>In a collaboration with CCM<em>, </em>CASTO
      expanded its investments into the U.S. Southeast region, focusing on
      Florida and North Carolina markets. The partnership crystallized and
      operates today as Casto Southeast. Its portfolio consists of a wide range
      of products managed and leased, including neighborhood grocery-anchored
      centers, mixed-use projects and triple-net outparcel developments. CASTO
      Southeast also has a robust third-party management and leasing presence
      overseeing 4.6 million square feet.</p><h2>CASTO and CCM Group</h2><p>In
      1999 the partnership of CASTO Southeast and CCM Group completed a
      redevelopment of the former Winter Park Mall in Winter Park, Florida, into
      an open-air lifestyle center and renamed the center Winter Park Village,
      which was the first of its kind. The 524,000-square-foot mixed-use project
      features more than 350,000 square feet of upscale retail and
      entertainment, 115,000-square-feet of office and 58 loft apartment
      units.</p><p>This redevelopment propelled the partnership into the
      mixed-use development arena. Within a decade of entering the mixed-use
      market, our partnership built Park West Village, a 100-acre,
      504,000-square-feet mixed-use project in Morrisville, North Carolina,
      among other projects in the southeast United States.</p><p>Today, CSE-CCM
      Real Estate Investments is the holding company for Winter Park Village,
      Park West Village, and other properties in operation and under
      development.</p>
